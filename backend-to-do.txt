Evendr To-do backend

ASAP:
1. Create a comprehensive list of event categories and event types 
	- Load these into MongoDB
		- Make sure that each collection has some basic schema validation rules (ie what the type of each value should be (string, array, etc.)
	- Make it easy to add/delete/modify existing categories/types data in the future 
		- via mongoose
2. Connect to Calendars:
	- Google
	- Outlook
	- Apple
	============
	- Given the user's credentials/permission, read the user's calendar 
	- Store the user's future calendar data efficiently.
3. Basic event scraping pipeline (see #1 in Later)
4. Basic authentication (login, registration)
	- Creation of a new user, and storage of their personal information (Name, email, etc.)
	- Login functionality
	- Change password functionality
	- JWT Authentication functionality
5. 

Later:
1. Create an event scraping, cleaning, filtering, and storing pipeline
	- Scrape events data from various sources.
	- Normalize/clean the data.
	- Assign category(ies) to each event (ie Knicks game would be of type 'Basketball game')
		- May need to utilize an LLM for this - look into Llamma 2 - it's free, and can be pre-trained on our existing categories/types
	- Before storing the data, make sure the event does not already exist in storage.
2. Cache the event names/categories in Redis
3.
