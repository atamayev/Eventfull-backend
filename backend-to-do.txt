Evendr To-do backend

- Test what happens when logging in via google when an account already exists in the db
	both what happens when the account is of type google, and if the account is of type local
- Need to add a payload that contains the userId (just like for local login) when logging in with google


Short-term technical stuff:
1. Add schema validation rules in mongodb
2. Figure out the importing src/ files problem

ASAP:
## Connect to Calendars:
	- Google
	- Outlook
	- Apple
	============
	- Given the user's credentials/permission, read the user's calendar 
	- Store the user's future calendar data efficiently.
## Basic event scraping pipeline (see #1 in Later)

Later:
## Create an event scraping, cleaning, filtering, and storing pipeline
	- Scrape events data from various sources.
	- Normalize/clean the data.
	- Assign category(ies) to each event (ie Knicks game would be of type 'Basketball game')
		- May need to utilize an LLM for this - look into Llamma 2 - it's free, and can be pre-trained on our existing categories/types
	- Before storing the data, make sure the event does not already exist in storage.
## Cache the event names/categories in Redis
